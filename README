Description: A single html file that uses the Opsview API to display
all unhandled problems nicely.

Usage: Put this file in your Nagios share directory, for example
'/usr/local/nagios/share/'.  It should now be accessible via browser
with 'http://your.opsview.webserver/unhandled.html'.  If you haven't
already logged in to Opsview, you will be redirected to the login,
after which you can return to unhandled.html with the proper rights
to access the Opsview JSON API.
